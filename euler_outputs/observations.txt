**Key observations (example):**
- Landing range error |ΔR| decreases as dt shrinks (Euler is first-order).
- For dt around 0.02–0.01 s, the landing x is often a “pretty good” match.
- x(t) error tends to grow ~linearly; y(t) error can grow faster near landing.
- Explicit Euler does not conserve energy; smaller dt reduces the drift.
- Try varying v0 and theta and repeat the dt sweep; note stability of your “good” dt.
